# Rewards

## Fees

Represent liquidity pool trading fees from the previous epoch distributed to
voters in pool tokens (e.g., if the pool is `vAMM-VELO/USDC` the distributed
tokens are `$VELO` and `$USDC`). Trading fees generated in the current epoch
will be distributed as rewards after the next epoch voting round.

These rewards are available for claim after the epoch flips
(after Wednesday 23:59 UTC), and are proportional to the voting power cast by a
voter (`$veVELO`).

## Incentives

In addition to the fees, liquidity pools allow external rewards from anyone
(known as _incentives_). Incentives can be added to _whitelisted_ pools and are distributed
_only_ to voters on that pool, proportionally to their share of pool votes.

These rewards are available for claim after the epoch flips
(after Wednesday 23:59 UTC), and are proportional to the voting power cast by a
voter (`$veVELO`).

## Rewards claim

Rebase rewards claim is available one full epoch after tokens are locked.
External incentives rewards are claimable after a new epoch has started (epochs increment right after 23:59 UTC each Wednesday).

An example of incentives, voting, and rewards claim timeline:

- A new epoch starts Thursday (00:00 UTC)
- Incentives are deposited at any point in the epoch
- Voters vote for their preferred pools
- Once the next epoch arrives (the following Thursday), users are able to claim rewards
